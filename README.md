# Minesweeper

This program is a simple implementation of Minesweeper. 

The user is presented with a number of unlabeled square buttons in a grid, and some of these squares contain hidden mines. 
The user can click a square to reveal it, and the goal is to reveal all of the safe squares without clicking any of the mines. 
When a safe square is revealed, it is labeled with the number of mines in the 8 surrounding squares. 
If the user suspects that a square has a mine, they can mark it with a flag, which prevents it from being accidentally revealed.
